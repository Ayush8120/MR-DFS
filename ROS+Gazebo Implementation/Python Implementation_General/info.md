------------------------------
-This is the raw original python implementation . 
-No ROS No Gazebo involved. 
-Just decide upon a topology , get the cordinates from MATLAB plot.[Use MATLAB_implementation_ver_0]
-Run the algorithm here by running the main.py
------------------------------
Current Topology is of : 10 Robots 24 Nodes; The topology cordinates were found by running the MATLAB_implementation_ver_0.
